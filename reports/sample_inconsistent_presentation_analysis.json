Slide 6 directly contradicts this by stating 'limited competition' with 'only 3 major competitors' and 'low competitive pressure'. Slide 9 further exacerbates this by presenting both 'low-competition environment' and 'highly competitive market' as highlights, indicating a severe and unresolved inconsistency regarding a core market characteristic."
