### Severity Breakdown

- üî¥ **High:** 2
- üö® **Critical:** 2

### üö® Critical Severity Issues

#### 1. Conflicting figures for total annual savings in lost productivity hours.

- **Type:** Numerical Conflict
- **Affected Slides:** 1, 2, 7
- **Confidence Score:** 1.00

**Evidence:**
- *slide_1:* Impact: $2M (Saved in lost productivity hours)
- *slide_2:* $3M saved in lost productivity hours annually
- *slide_7:* Overall Productivity Gains | ...save $2M in lost productivity

**Explanation:**
Slide 1 and Slide 7 consistently state '$2M' in lost productivity savings, while Slide 2 explicitly states '$3M' for the same metric. This is a direct numerical contradiction.

#### 2. Conflicting figures for time saved per slide created.

- **Type:** Numerical Conflict
- **Affected Slides:** 1, 2, 7
- **Confidence Score:** 1.00

**Evidence:**
- *slide_1:* 15 mins Saved per slide created
- *slide_2:* 20 mins saved per slide created
- *slide_7:* Overall Productivity Gains | ...Achieving 15 minutes saved per slide created

**Explanation:**
Slide 1 and Slide 7 state '15 mins' saved per slide, whereas Slide 2 claims '20 mins' saved per slide. These figures directly contradict each other.


### üî¥ High Severity Issues

#### 1. Conflicting claims regarding the speed increase in deck creation.

- **Type:** Numerical Conflict
- **Affected Slides:** 1, 2
- **Confidence Score:** 1.00

**Evidence:**
- *slide_1:* Noogat helps consultants make decks 2x faster using AI
- *slide_2:* 3x faster deck creation speed

**Explanation:**
Slide 1 claims Noogat helps make decks '2x faster', while Slide 2 claims '3x faster deck creation speed'. These are mutually exclusive claims about the product's core benefit.

#### 2. The stated total monthly hours saved per consultant on Slide 3 does not match the sum of its own detailed breakdown.

- **Type:** Numerical Conflict
- **Affected Slides:** 3
- **Confidence Score:** 1.00

**Evidence:**
- *slide_3:* Title: Noogat: 50 Hours Saved Per Consultant Monthly
Detailed breakdown: Automated Formatting (10 hours) + Content Generation (12 hours) + Chart & Table Creation (8 hours) + Layout Optimization (6 hours) + Review & QA (4 hours) = 40 hours.

**Explanation:**
The sum of the individual time-saving categories listed on Slide 3 (10+12+8+6+4 = 40 hours) does not add up to the prominent claim of '50 Hours Saved Per Consultant Monthly' in the slide's title and main heading.


### üü° Medium Severity Issues

#### 1. Inconsistent presentation of Noogat's total monthly time savings categories across slides, leading to potential misrepresentation of total impact.

- **Type:** Logical Inconsistency
- **Affected Slides:** 3, 4, 7
- **Confidence Score:** 0.90

**Evidence:**
- *slide_3:* Lists 5 categories summing to 40 hours (despite claiming 50 hours total).
- *slide_4:* Lists only 3 categories for Noogat (10+12+8 = 30 hours) as 'significant monthly time savings', omitting 'Layout Optimization' and 'Review & QA'.
- *slide_7:* Lists the same 5 categories as Slide 3, summing to 40 hours.

**Explanation:**
While the individual category values (Automated Formatting, Content Generation, Chart & Table Creation) are consistent across slides 3, 4, and 7, Slide 4 only presents a partial sum (30 hours) by omitting two categories (Layout Optimization and Review & QA) that are included in Slides 3 and 7. This creates an inconsistent representation of Noogat's total time savings and could mislead the audience about the full scope of benefits, especially when Slide 3 claims 50 hours and sums to 40 hours, and Slide 7 confirms the 40-hour sum.
